\begin{itemize}
\item[Analysis:] Analyzed dependency matrix in IntelliJ Pro
\item[Analysis:] Found cyclical dependencies, can be eliminated with some patterns.
\item[Analysis:] ExactWizard is gui component
\item[Analysis:] ExactModel is model object, passed to SoverClient which then sends to SolverDispatcher;
\item[Suggestion:] No abstract layer between SolverClient and SolverDispatcher (use interface)
\item[Analysis:] SolverDispatcher: solves problem by delegating problem to other classes depending on type of problem.
\item[Analysis:] SolverAlgorithm looks very bad, too much dependency with SolverDispatcher
\item[Suggestion:] Some classes not used at all by JMVA in jmt.analytical, so should be moved moved out to reduce dependency
\item[Analysis:] Write a table of responsibilities of main classes and which packages they're part of
\end{itemize}
