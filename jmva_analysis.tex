\begin{itemize}
\item[Analysis:] Analyzed dependency matrix in IntelliJ Pro
\item[Analysis:] Found cyclical dependencies, can be eliminated with some patterns.
\item[Analysis:] ExactWizard is gui component
\item[Analysis:] ExactModel is model object, passed to SoverClient which then sends to SolverDispatcher;
\item[Suggestion:] No abstract layer between SolverClient and SolverDispatcher (use interface)
\item[Analysis:] SolverDispatcher: solves problem by delegating problem to other classes depending on type of problem.
\item[Analysis:] SolverAlgorithm looks very bad, too much dependency with SolverDispatcher
\item[Suggestion:] Some classes not used at all by JMVA in jmt.analytical, so should be moved moved out to reduce dependency
\item[Analysis:] Write a table of responsibilities of main classes and which packages they're part of
\item[Cycle] gui.exact.ExactModel cycle with analytical package (Exact model depends 136 times on analytical and analytical depends 68 times on ExactModel
\item[Design] gui package should be top layer of application rather than analytical; gui should be top of the layer and analytical should depend on it.  recommend splitting up gui and taking out ExactModel into a separate package
\item gui contains ExactModel which depends on SolverClient (also in gui), which depends on SolverDispather (in analytical); thus if we remove ExactModel out
\end{itemize}

Code issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Naming:] Classes are poorly names (ExactWizard is a gui window), main method is obscured, 
\item[Comments:] Sparse comments and sometimes written in Italian, making difficult to figure out what's going on; encoding issues in comments (UTF8 vs ISO-8859-1).
\item[Methods:] Very many "solve" methods which do not do the solving but rather delegate elsewhere.
\end{itemize}

Other issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item[Testability:] 
\item[File Size:] ExactModel has >2800 LOC, not cohesive design
\item[Interfaces:] Little use of interfaces to allow for looser coupling between packages and to allow more Mock and Unit testing.
\end{itemize}
